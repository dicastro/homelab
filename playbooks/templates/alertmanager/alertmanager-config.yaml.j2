  # Email notification configuration is currently not used.
  #
  # Mailrise (1.4.0) was used as an SMTP relay, but Alertmanager (v0.28.1) failed to authenticate with it.
  # Mailrise supports SMTP authentication using LOGIN and PLAIN methods (over TLS),
  # and Alertmanager is expected to support these methods â€” but authentication still failed.
  #
  # A possible workaround is to set up a dedicated VM running Postfix as a mail relay.
  # Postfix would be configured to require authentication exposing only PLAIN (over TLS),
  # which Alertmanager should be able to use. If that succeeds, Postfix can then forward
  # the messages to Mailrise.
  #
  # This setup moves the SMTP compatibility burden from Alertmanager to Postfix,
  # which handles mail protocols more flexibly and reliably.
